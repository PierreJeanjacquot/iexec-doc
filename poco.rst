Proof Of Contribution
=====================

*this documentation is related to the V3 version of iExec, released mid 2019*


The iExec platform provides a network where application provider, workers, and users can gather and work together. The fully decentralized nature of iExec implies that no single agent is trusted by default, and that those agents require incentives to contribute correctly.

In this context, Proof-of-Contribution (PoCo) is the protocol used by iExec for consensus over off-chain computing.
