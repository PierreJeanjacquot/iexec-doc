Welcome to iExec
=================

**What is iExec?**

iExec is the first decentralized marketplace for cloud resources. The iExec platform allows everyone to monetize their applications, servers and data-sets.

**What is your need?**


FOR PROVIDERS
As a Provider, you can lend your machine power and monetize it by executing developer applications.
Go to the 'Be a worker' section to learn how to deploy your worker software.
For advanced users, you can learn how to deploy your own scheduler in the 'Be a scheduler' section.

FOR DAPPUSER

As a Dapp user, you can run decentralized apps submited to the iExec platform. 
Pick a Dapp on our Dapp store (https://dapps.iex.ec) and learn in the 'Submit a Work Order' section how to run dapps with the iExec SDK.

FOR DEVELOPERS
As a Developer, you can use iExec to overcome blockchain limitations, by executing your computations on a new distributed infrastructure.
Go to the 'DEVELOP' section to learn how to build Dapps (binaries or docker images) for the community

**Why do we use it?**

.. note:: It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
          more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content    here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
          web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
          evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
