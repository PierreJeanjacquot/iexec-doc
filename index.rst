**What is iExec?**


| iExec is a multi-sided platform for computing resources.
| It is a network connecting providers and users of distributed computing power, datasets and developers, encouraging an ecosystem of decentralized and autonomous, privacy-preserving applications.
| iExec therefore creates a new paradigm for cloud computing: a global and open market where computing power is traded like a commodity.
