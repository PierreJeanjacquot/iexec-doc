Introduction
============

What is iExec?
--------------

Iexec is a multi-sided platform for the computing resources. This network, connecting power of computation, datasets, applications providers, developpers and requestors, enables to create new innovative products
as computing intensive autonomous applications, privacy and property preserving applications.


For resources providers
-----------------------

The resources provider is organized similarly to the mining pool.
The master machine manages the distribution of computation and the reward for all connected workers.

Worker:
~~~~~~~

| As a Provider, you can lend your machine power and monetize it by executing developer applications.
| They are individuals or companies who own computing resources and are willing to make them available for the computation of tasks against payments in RLC.
| Similarly to blockchain miners, they want a simple solution that will make their computer part of a large infrastructure that will take care of the details for them.
| Any computing resources can join the market to offer computing resources.

Go to the `Be a worker`_ section to learn how to deploy your worker software.

.. _Be a worker: /worker.html

Workerpool:
~~~~~~~~~~~

| Worker pools organize workers contributions and are led by a scheduler, who organises the work load and publish the workorder to the market.
| They can either be public and federate resources from anyone or private and try to optimise the management of specific hardware.
| While not doing the actual computation, they receive a fee for the management of the infrastructure.
| They compete to attract workers, which they do by achieving an efficient management which guarantees the income of workers.

Go to the `Be a worker pool`_ section to learn how to deploy your worker pool software.

Check out the worker pool present on the market (https://pools.iex.ec)


For Dapp users
--------------

| As a Dapp user, you can run decentralized apps submitted to the iExec platform.
| Blockchains offer very limited computing capacities to run decentralized applications: few kilobytes of storage, very inefficient virtual machine and very high latency protocol.
| Eventually, blockchain technology will evolve to overcome some of these issues, but there will be an ever growing need to provide additional capacities to all but the simplest applications
| The existing clouds cannot fulfill the requirements of DApps that need fully decentralized infrastructures for their execution

Pick a Dapp on our Dapp store (https://dapps.iex.ec) and learn in the `Submit a Work Order`_ section how to run dapps with the iExec SDK.

For developers
--------------

| Developers can make their applications available for a fixed fee following the pay per task model .
| As a developer of decentralized applications, you can use iExec to overcome blockchain limitations( cost and performance), by executing your computations "off chain" on a new distributed infrastructure.

Why using containers?

Go to the `DEVELOP`_ section to learn how to build Dapps (binaries or docker images) for the community

For Data providers
------------------

Data wallet will be available in the next major release V3, planned for may 2019

| They own valuable datasets and are willing to make them available, in a secure paradigm that protects their ownership, against payments in RLC.
| Combined with the Intel SGX, the IBM datashield technologies and the pay-per-task model, the data wallet opens new opportunities to create applications dealing(respecting?) with privacy and ownership


For requestors
--------------

| User friendly access to power of computation and applications throw the marketplace (https://market.iex.ec) and the dapp store (https://dapps.iex.ec) with many ready-to-use applications
| The multi-sided market allows to trade applications, the requestors set requestorder for an "ask" publication, a computing resources provider should accept the deal and process this requestorder at the price fixed by the requestor.
| The pay per task model and the blockchain allow a finest control for your operating expense for computation.
| Requestors can define a level of trust to make sure that the results they receive are correct.
| Select the resources providers with geographical or energy management criteria , such as green computing.
| Secure and privacy preserving data and application on cloud computing environment.
| Monitoring and audit of all computing activities.
