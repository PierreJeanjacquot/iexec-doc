| Comparable to the oil market, the iExec marketplace offers a uniform and standardized access to computing resources, regardless of their provider.
| iExec strengthens applications running on Ethereum smart contracts, allowing for off-chain computation services and datasets on-demand.
| This is made possible by the iExec Proof-of-Contribution or PoCo consensus protocol that validates off-chain computations.

For Computing Resource Providers
================================

iExec distinguishes between 3 different types of cloud resource providers :

 - **Application providers**

Your algorithms can change the world! Developers and application providers can monetize their apps, dapps, functions or algorithms.

 - **Computing providers**

No more CPU cycle wasted! Computing providers can make the most of their servers, by joining the iExec network and renting them.

 - **Data providers**

Data is the new gold!
Data providers can monetize datasets usage and open up new revenue streams for their assets.
A single entity can be all types of providers at the same time.


Application Providers
---------------------

Application providers can monetize their applications and algorithms by setting a fixed-fee for each single usage of their software (pay-per-task model).
As a developer of decentralized applications, you may use iExec to overcome blockchain limitations (few kilobytes of storage, very inefficient virtual machines and very high latency protocol) by executing your computations “off-chain” on the iExec decentralized infrastructure.
Developers also benefit from being free from adjusting resource allocation. By not having to maintain any servers, developers deploy applications that can rapidly upscale/downscale based on user-demand.

Dataset providers
-----------------

Dataset provider can monetize their datas by setting a fixed-fee for each single usage of their software (pay-per-task model).
Dataset can be seen as a wide concept to protect,
iExec allows with multiple levels of security to monetize any data: data means dataset or more advanced valuable models as AI trained model,

Computing Providers
-------------------

Within the iExec network, providers of computing power are called ‘Workers’.
As a worker, you can connect your machine to the network and provide computing power.

Your machine executes computational tasks in exchange for a reward in RLC tokens.
Workers can be individuals or companies.
Anyone owning computing resources can make them available by joining a “worker pool” and renting computing power to the network.
Any machine, from an individual laptop to a large-scale data center, can join a worker pool.

Head to the `How to become a worker`_ section to learn how to deploy your worker software.

Worker pools are made up of multiple individual machines.
They are led by a Pool manager, a lead entity that organizes the workload and signals how many tasks it is able to process and at which price.

**The Pool Manager freely determines the pricing to execute computational task for its workers.**

Pool manager, while not doing the actual computation, receive a fee for the management of the worker pool.
Pool manager compete to attract workers to their worker pool by providing efficient management and guaranteeing earnings for workers.

Head to the `How to Become a pool manager`_ section to learn how to deploy your worker pool service.

You may also check out the list of worker pool currently available on the iExec Marketplace in the `Pools Catalog <https://pools.iex.ec>`_.

Data providers
--------------

Data providers that own valuable datasets can make them available for use by applications through the iExec Data Store.

iExec pay per task model empowers Intel SGX and IBM Datashield to offer new opportunities of creating highly-secure applications that respect data privacy and ownership.


For Cloud Resource Requesters
=============================


Buying applications, computing power and datasets
-------------------------------------------------

'Requester' is the name given to an individual or enterprise requesting the use of cloud resources through iExec.

iExec allows requesters (individuals and enterprises) to access affordable, secure and scalable cloud resources.


  - **Access to applications**

  On the `iExec Dapp Store <https://dapps.iex.ec>`_, requesters have access to an extensive list of ready-to-use decentralized applications.


  - **Access to computing power**

  On the `iExec Marketplace <https://market.iex.ec>`_, requesters have access to large amounts of computational power from a variety of computing providers
  (networks of individuals, private data centers, Green IT providers, Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) worker pools).

  Computing resources can be traded as any commodities. In the cloud market today, providers generally charge a flat rate for all resources per time.

  On the iExec marketplace, a requester submits a task request that can be fulfilled by available computing resources.


  - **Access to datasets**

  On the `iExec Data Store <https://data.iex.ec>`_, requesters have access to a large amount of varied datasets that can be opened from associated dapps from the Dapp Store.

  Requesters browses available cloud resources and triggers an execution in just a few clicks.

  They can then monitor and audit all the orders they have triggered since each activity log is recorded on the blockchain.


Secure and privacy-preserving cloud computing
---------------------------------------------

iExec offers optional full end-to-end trusted and private execution on the decentralized cloud.

End-to-end protection means full protection of the application data, user data, embedded data as well as application output data.

Results can never be inspected by anyone else but their requester, answering the needs of highly-confidential applications and sensitive datasets.
