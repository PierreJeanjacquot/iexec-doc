For resources providers
-----------------------

| Worker:
| As a Provider, you can lend your machine power and monetize it by executing developer applications.
| They are individuals or companies who own computing resources and are willing to make them available for the computation of tasks against payments in RLC.
| Similarly to blockchain miners, they want a simple solution that will make their computer part of a large infrastructure that will take care of the details for them.
| Any computing resources can join the market to offer computing resources.

Go to the `Be a worker`_ section to learn how to deploy your worker software.

| Workerpool:
| Worker pools organize workers contributions and are led by a scheduler, who organises the work distribution.
| They can either be public and federate resources from anyone or private and try to optimise the management of specific hardware.
| While not doing the actual computation, they receive a fee for the management of the infrastructure.
| They compete to attract workers, which they do by achieving an efficient management which guarantees the income of workers.

Go to the `Be a worker pool`_ section to learn how to deploy your worker pool software.

For Dapp users
--------------

As a Dapp user, you can run decentralized apps submited to the iExec platform.
Pick a Dapp on our Dapp store (https://dapps.iex.ec) and learn in the `Submit a Work Order`_ section how to run dapps with the iExec SDK.

For developers
--------------

As a Developer, you can use iExec to overcome blockchain limitations, by executing your computations on a new distributed infrastructure.
Go to the `DEVELOP`_ section to learn how to build Dapps (binaries or docker images) for the community
